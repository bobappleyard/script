# An attempt at a better transcript

This is a new spin on the TranScript idea. The hope is to streamline some of the
mechanisms, making them more general as well as more efficient.

There isn't much to show for it at the moment. The plan of action is:

1. Build a bytecode interpreter that knows nothing about the source syntax and
   little about libraries.

2. Write the builtins. Try to minimise these (Object, Class, Int, Float, String,
   Array, Method, Primitive, Field).

3. Build a compiler in transcript v1.

4. Build a standard library in v2.

5. Build a compiler in v2.
